This repository contains the [Eclipse Lyo](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.lyo) Designer library.

Lyo Designer is an Eclipse plugin that allows one to graphically model (1) the overall system architecture, (2) the information model of the RDF resources being shared, and (3) the individual services and operations of each Server in the system. 

Lyo Designer includes a integrated code generator that synthesizes the model into almost-complete OSLC4J-compliant running implementation.

## Introduction

The [Eclipse Lyo](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.lyo) project is focused on providing an SDK to enable adoption of [OSLC specifications](https://open-services.net/). OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration) is an open community dedicated to reducing barriers for lifecycle tool integration. The community authors specifications for exposing lifecycle artifacts through uniform (REST) interfaces and relying on Internet and Linked Data standards.

OSLC's scope started with Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) and is expanding to include integrations across Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) and IT Service Management (ISM/DevOps), Lyo is designed to be a companion to the continuing specification efforts of the OSLC community. Its main purpose is to expand adoption of OSLC specifications and to enable the Eclipse community to easily build OSLC compliant tools.

## Installation

See [Lyo Designer installation guide](http://oslc.github.io/developing-oslc-applications/eclipse_lyo/install-lyo-designer.html) for complete details.
